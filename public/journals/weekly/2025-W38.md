## Weekly Performance
This week was positive, with a net gain of +2.5%. The majority of profits came from momentum trades during the US session.

### What Worked
- Identifying strong intraday trends.
- Risk management was on point; max drawdown was limited to 0.5%.

### What Didn't Work
- Over-trading on Wednesday, leading to small unnecessary losses.

## Plan for Next Week
Focus on quality over quantity. Aim for 1-2 high-probability setups per day.
